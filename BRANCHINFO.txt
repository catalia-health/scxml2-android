                     COMMONS SCXML
                       J6 BRANCH

                    -- PURPOSE --

To improve the Commons SCXML codebase using JDK 5 and 6 features.

                    -- STATUS --

Under active development (see TASKS section at the end).

                    -- DETAILS --

This is an experimental branch to explore improvements to the Commons
SCXML codebase using JDK 5 and 6 features (originally authored for JDK 1.4).

Commons SCXML uses JDK Collections extensively as part of the implementation
details. Generics can pretty some of that implementation.

While there are no plans as yet to leverage annotations to describe state
machines (it is deemed relatively difficult to author state machines in such
a "distributed manner"), it may be possible to use them for lesser tasks
within the library.

Other JDK 5 language improvements may come handy as well.
