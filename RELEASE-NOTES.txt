ABOUT COMMONS SCXML:

The Commons SCXML (State Chart XML) project provides a generic
state-machine based execution environment. It borrows most semantics
from its namesake Working Draft at the W3C. Anything that can be
represented as a UML state chart -- business process flows, view
navigation bits, interaction or dialog management, and many more -- can
leverage the Commons SCXML library. The library abstracts out the
environment interfaces, and can be used in numerous server-side and
client-side runtimes.
