# scxml2-android

## A version of the [Apache Commons SCXML2](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-scxml/) implementation that runs on Android.

Minimal set of changes, primarily around logging, to enable compiling and running SCXML2 on the Android platform.  These changes are as non-invasive as possible and while they do not change the functionality of the state machine code, they do have subtle effects on what gets logged.

See the "minimal" branch for a more trimmed-down version of this implementation, specific to our needs.

Contributions are welcome.
